##Time Tracker
This Swift iOS app allows users to track the hours spent on given activities. Users can add, edit or delete activities of any length of time, and a progress page shows the breakdown of the percentage of time they spend on each activity by day, week, or month.

2. Add exit to the popover when adding a new activity. </br>
3. Solve bug with deleting the first history item </br>
4. Clean up the UI and make it adaptive. </br>

Below are some screenshots of the current state of the app. < /br>
